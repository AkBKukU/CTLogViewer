CTLogViewer
===========

A viewer for the log files that core temp generates

This program is in it's early design phase but aims to be a useful tool for interpreting the information that core temp logs.

Current Status
--------------

Right now the program can load a folder of logs into log objects and access all the data in them. The next phase is a bit of error handling and the a basic gui.
